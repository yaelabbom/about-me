# Hi, I'm Yael 👋
I'm a sophomore studying Applied Data Science, with a minor in Business at St. Edward’s University in the Honors Program.

I'm interested in data science, machine learning, data analytics, and applied AI, especially how data-driven tools are used in real-world decision making.

## 📂 Projects
This repository will serve as a hub for my data science projects, including data analysis, visualization, and applied machine learning work.
